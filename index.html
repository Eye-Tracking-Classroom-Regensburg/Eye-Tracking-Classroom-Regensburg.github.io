							<h1>The Eye-Tracking Laboratory on campus of the University of Regensburg</h1>
							<p>Since 2019, the <a href="https://www.oth-regensburg.de/">Ostbayerische Technische Hochschule</a> and the <a href="https://www.uni-regensburg.de/">University of Regensburg</a> operate a joint Eye-Tracking-Laboratory on campus in Regensburg. In the facility, which is equipped with the latest technology, research is conducted on new findings in the field of user behavior and interaction with modern digital systems. The 14 interconnected high-performance eye trackers are an unique selling point. By networking these devices, new research areas are opened up, especially regarding the investigation and support of collaborative tasks through gaze data acquisition.</p>

							<h2>Equipment</h2>
							<p>The Tobii Spectrum 600 eye trackers used in the laboratory are connected to modern workstations. The workstations reside within the same local network and thus allow parallel recording and real-time streaming of gaze data from multipleusers. In addition to opening up new fields of research, this also enables a more efficient way to conduct classical eye-tracking studies with large samples. Especially, educational studies profit from a higher ecological validity due to the classroom setup.</p>
							<p>Alongside a separate observation area, the main laboratory area is oriented towards classical learning/teaching environments. Consequently, the majority of the systems is installed there. This setup allows the in situ observation and evaluation of teaching situations, e.g. the didactic sharing of content in a classroom. The setup is complemented by specially adapted head-mounted displays, which allow the examination of gaze data in virtual environments. Additional workstations in the observation area enable the evaluation of recorded experiments parallel to laboratory operations.</p>
							<p>The entire equipment of the eye-tracking laboratory was funded by the FHInvest project "Eyes on Future". This BMBF-funded initiative is specifically intended to expand the research-relevant infrastructure at German universities and to create new research and cooperation opportunities.</p>

							<h2>Research</h2>
							<p>The special equipment of the laboratory enables the investigation of a wide range of topics that reflect the mutual as well as varying research interests of the partners involved. Key objectives are the investigation and support of user behavior in the context of software development, the improvement of learning and teaching situations, as well as the investigation and integration of new interaction modalities in digital systems.</p>
							<h3>Recent studies</h3>
							<p>The hardware of the eye tracking laboratory has already been utilised in three studies. Security aspects of e-mail clients, the reading behavior of programmers in C ++ reviews and anomalies in medical and hospital hygiene were examined. Future planned projects deal with the different forms of representation of code during the software development life cycle, visual expertise in radiologists and teachers‘ eye movements during class.</p>

							<h2>Software Engineering Education in Co-located Multi-User Eye-Tracking-Environments</h2>
							<p>This tutorial explores the application of Eye-Tracking technology for Software Engineering education. We show a research gap concerning its usage for real- time improvement of traditional learning scenarios and outline a number of activities to generate research ideas and prototypical solutions to close this gap. We describe our expertise as active researchers in the relevant fields and propose a possible format to document the outcomes of this workshop for further studies.</p>
